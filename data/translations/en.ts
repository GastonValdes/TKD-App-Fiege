Always be a good example for lower belts. It is natural for them to want and try to emulate more advanced students.\n4. Always be loyal and never criticize the instructor, Taekwon-Do or the teaching methods.\n5. If an instructor teaches you a technique practice it and try to use it.\n6. Remember that the student's behavior outside of class reflects on the art and the instructor.\n7. If a student adopts a technique from another gym and the instructor disapproves of it, the student must either discard it immediately or train at the gym where the technique was learned. 8.

It represents wisdom, long career, experience.\n\nThe number 9 is not only the highest among the single-digit numbers, but it is also the result of the number 3 multiplied by 3. In the East, the number 3 is the most esteemed of all numbers. The character of the Chinese alphabet (the basis of the Korean Alphabet) that represents the number 3, contains 3 lines: (The top one symbolizes Heaven, the middle one Mortals and the bottom one Earth)\n\nWhen the number 3 is multiplied by itself, the equation is 9, the highest of the numbers, therefore, the ninth category (9th Dan) is the highest of all the belt ranks. It is also interesting to note that when the number 9 is multiplied by some other single digit and then the 2 resulting numbers are added together, the equation will always equal 9.\n\nWhite: Represents purity or innocence, meaning the student has no knowledge of Taekwon-Do.\n\nYellow: Represents the earth from which the plant sprouts and takes root, as the foundation of Taekwon-Do is laid in the student.\n\nGreen: Signifies growth of the plant, as the skill of Taekwon-Do begins to develop (grow) in the practitioner.\n\nBlue: Represents the sky towards which the Taekwon-Do tree grows, as Taekwon-Do training progresses.\n\nRed: Signifies danger, alerting the student to exercise control and warning the opponent to keep his distance.\n\nBlack: Opposite of white, therefore signifying maturity and the practitioner’s efficiency in Taekwon-Do.",

The undulating motion is a motion in which the body's center of gravity would form a sine wave. Two reasons lead to this motion: Relaxation Increasing speed through height gain Performing the undulating motion of the center of gravity involves keeping the legs and arms slightly bent during the movement. This forces the body to relax which adds speed to the technique at the end of the movement. According to the theory of power, small increases in speed produce large increases in the power of the technique. When using the undulating motion, the knees must be flexed appropriately. Flexion of the knees is what allows the body to lower and raise as it moves forward. At the end of the movement, we take advantage of gravity and speed by rapidly lowering the center of gravity. The movement of the center of mass is: down, up, down as seen in the figure:\n\n In some cases the complete undulation is not performed as in the fast movements (where the second chained movement only up-down), connected (where the second chained movement only performs the downward movement)",

The most important competitions worldwide are the World Cup (where the teams of each country gather) and the World Cup (open tournament with free registration). As a sport, it is comprised of five facets: • Wrestling (individual and team). • Pre-established fighting. • Power techniques (breaks). • Special techniques (breaks). • Forms (individual and team). Taekwon-Do is an art, a path that seeks perfection, both for the practitioner (morally, physically and technically), as well as the art itself (which is perfected over time), because it encompasses a series of concepts and principles through which a more integrated and moral world is sought.

    "titletheory4":"Reaction Force:",
    "theory4": "According to Newton, each force generates an equal and opposite force.\nWe can distinguish two types:\n - Own reaction force: taking the example of a punch, we bring the opposite fist to the side of the hip to achieve maximum effectiveness.\n - Opponent's reaction force: our own reaction force is added to that of an adversary moving towards us.",

    "theory5": "The shorter the concentration time, the greater the impact power.\nThere are two types of concentration:\n- concentration of each muscle of the body and the appropriate tool to use at the right moment.\n- concentration of each muscle of the body on the vital point of the opponent.",

    "theory6": "The body must always be properly balanced for the techniques to be effective. There are two types of balance that are closely related, static and dynamic. The weight is distributed over both legs or over the centre of the foot. Two important points to bear in mind are: - Flexion and mobility of the knee joint to maintain balance in a technique and its quick recovery. - The heel of the back foot must not come off the ground at the moment of impact in order to achieve maximum power at the point of impact.",
    "titletheory7":"Respiratory control:",
    "theory7": "Slow inhalation helps prepare the movement. Exhalation should be done at the moment of impact, this concentrates greater tension and achieves greater power in the technique performed. Controlled breathing acts not only on resistance and speed, but can also control the body when receiving a blow and increase the power of a blow directed towards the opponent.",
    "titletheory8":"Mass:",
    "theory8": "Greater power is achieved through:\n1- Rotation of the hip or limbs.\n2- Undulating movement, generated by the flexion-extension of the knees that allow the elevation of the hip while the movement is being performed and its descent at the moment of impact.\n Mass x speed squared = Power",

The undulating motion is a motion in which the body's center of gravity would form a sine wave. Two reasons lead to this motion:\n\n • Relaxation.\n • Increasing speed through a gain in height.\n\nPerforming the undulating motion of the center of gravity involves keeping the legs and arms slightly bent during the movement. This forces the body to relax, which adds speed to the technique at the end of the movement. According to the theory of power, small increases in speed produce large increases in the power of the technique.\n\nWhen using the undulating motion, the knees must be properly flexed. Flexion of the knees is what allows the body to lower and raise as it moves forward. At the end of the movement, we take advantage of gravity and speed by rapidly lowering the center of gravity. The movement of the center of mass is: down, up, down as seen in the figure:\nIn some cases the complete undulation is not performed as in the fast movements (where the second chained movement only performs up-down), connected (where the second chained movement only performs the downward movement)",

        "theory4": "There is an old Eastern saying, `Patience leads to virtue or merit.` `One can build a more peaceful home by being patient 100 times.` Certainly, happiness and prosperity would seem to come from patient people. To achieve something, such as a high rank or technical perfection and obtain the desired goal, one must constantly persevere. Robert Bruce learned his lesson of perseverance from the persistent effort of a slow and lonely spider.\nIt was his perseverance and tenacity that finally made it possible to liberate Scotland in the 14th century. One of the most important secrets to becoming a leader in Taekwon-Do is to overcome all difficulties with perseverance.\nConfucius said, `He who is impatient in trivial matters will fail in his achievements in matters of great importance.`",

Loss of self-control in free combat can lead to disaster, both for oneself and for one's opponent. An inability to live and work at full capacity is also a loss of self-control.

It is manifested when a person faces an immense problem using his courage and without giving up his principles.\nA serious student of Taekwon-o must always be modest and honest. If he is confronted with injustice, he will act against the belligerent without any fear or hesitation, with an indomitable spirit, regardless of the number of people he must face.\n\nConfucius said: <<Not to protest against injustice is an act of cowardice.>>\nAs history has shown, those who pursue their dreams honestly and vigorously with an indomitable spirit have never failed to achieve their goals.",

        "titletheory1":"PREAMBLE",
        "theory1": "Since Taekwon-Do is an art of self-defense that addresses noble moral rearmament, a high degree of intellectual fulfillment, elegant techniques, and the beauty of physical form, it can be considered a part of everyday life, just like breathing and thinking. As the founder of Taekwon-Do, I wish to define its philosophy, principles, and objective so that these may be utilized to achieve the flourishing of morality, beauty, and power, in harmony with the immortal spirit.",
        "titletheory2":"PART 1",
        "theory2": "Through a scientific practice of Taekwon-Do one can greatly improve one's health and nourish one's intellect. One can find oneself in a position to help others in the cause of justice, thereby promoting social ethics and morality, contributing to a more peaceful and happy society.",
        "titletheory3":"PART 2",
        "theory3": "To live in good harmony with life, despite its detestable aspects, and with death, one must continually study the art of Taekwon-Do to learn the techniques of power and grace, and to enlarge one's spiritual realm. Thus the motivation to study must be an invaluable inheritance for future generations.",
        "titletheory4":"PART 3",
        "theory4": "Human beings come into the world with simple desires and needs. They must not become greedy, they must remain humble and merciful. They must never compromise their principles, nor set them aside for selfish reasons, in order to ensure the freedom and independence of Taekwon-Do and for it to be transmitted in its original form.",
        "titletheory5":"PART 4",
        "theory5": "All students of this art are subject to the same rules of behaviour and judged according to the same criteria without taking into consideration their position in life, their origins or their religious convictions, demonstrating to the world the essential equality and human brotherhood.",
        "titletheory6":"PART 5",
        "theory6": "Modern society is characterized by selfishness and unnecessary reliance on machines. Moral society is characterized by self-discipline, sacrifice, mutual aid and dedication. Devoting oneself to art can promote change towards a moral society.",

        "titletheory1":"Connotations",
        "theory1": "The diverse connotations and various possible interpretations of moral culture are often very difficult for a Western mind to grasp, because it is an aspect of Eastern philosophy that permeates the lives of Easterners. To put it in a word, it is the constant effort and process to become an exemplary person like Confusius (552-479 BC). To be such a person, one has to first find oneself and acquire a moral character that is respected by others. Thus, if that day comes, the mentally disciplined man can contribute to the building of an ideal society, giving wise advice to the government and even after death through his everlasting example. Confusius said: “To promote a sense of morality, one has to act towards others with loyalty and sincerity based on righteousness, and eliminate their vicious thoughts.”",

        "theory2": "When one of us, as social beings, wishes to live in a free and peaceful society, at the same time, it is our duty to build such a society for the people. I have quoted several words of wisdom from ancient saints and philosophers regarding the creation of an ideal society, in the hope that students of Taekwon-Do will use them as a guide in cultivating their moral culture. An ideal society according to LAO-TZU is one where the leader has such high moral character that he can lead naturally, without interference or fear but only by appealing to the good nature of his people, who only by performing their duty can live freely, in peace and without fear or anxiety.",
        "titletheory3":"Moral Society",
        "theory3": "Furthermore, a moral society is one where the people admire and praise their leader in gratitude for the love and goodwill that he offers to his people.",
        "titletheory4":"Legalistic Society",
        "theory4": "Thirdly, there is the `Legalist` society, in which the leader, due to a lack of moral authority, resorts to laws to govern his people, who obey out of fear of the retribution that violation of these laws brings. In such circumstances, the leader loses contact with his people.",
        "titletheory5":"The worst society",
        "theory5": "Finally, the worst kind of society is one in which the ruler, through deception and trickery, misuses his legal authority to pursue his personal ambitions and impose his rules on the people by force. In such a society the ruler is hated by the people and brings about his own downfall, that of his country and his people.",
        "titletheory6":"Moral Behavior",
        "theory6": "In Taekwon-Do, moral culture is highly emphasized, as it not only promotes a healthy body and a sound mind, but also sportsmanlike behavior and the strengthening of moral behavior.",
        "titletheory7":"Men sana in corpore sano",
        "theory7": "The ancient Greeks adopted a healthy mind in a healthy body and a creative spiritual concept. The more disciplined and cultivated the mind, the more disciplined and cultivated will be the student's use of Taekwon-Do.",
        "titletheory8":"The Lessons",
        "theory8": "There is no doubt that the lessons that follow may be quite difficult to understand, however, it is incumbent upon the serious student of Taekwon-Do to read, assimilate, and try to grasp these fundamental essences of moral culture.",
        "titletheory9":"Back to basic nature",
        "theory9": "Mencius proposes the following analogy when he states that man is fundamentally good. Even a thief of the worst kind, finding an innocent child about to fall into a well, will try to save him, forgetting for a moment his intention to rob the house. This good behaviour was obscured or entirely lost by greed for money and power.",
        "titletheory10":"Be virtuous",
        "theory10": "It is very difficult to define what it is, however, five human qualities have been considered as virtues since the most ancient times: humanity, righteousness, courtesy, wisdom and trust. To be virtuous one must constantly cultivate and practice these virtues. Confucius said: <<Virtue is like the North Star, all the stars revolve in order around it. So those who are around virtuous people will naturally act to achieve a better society. When the world is against me, I joyfully ask for self-improvement and when finally, the world recognizes me and requires me, I feel proud to assist it>>",

        "titletheory1":"Origins",
        "theory1": "Although the origins of martial arts are shrouded in mystery, we believe that since time immemorial there have been physical actions involving the use of hands and feet for the purpose of self-defense.\n\nIf we were to define these physical actions as Taekwon-Do, every country could claim to be the inventor of Taekwon-Do. However, there are few similarities between the Taekwon-Do practiced today and the primary forms of unarmed combat developed in the past.",
        "titletheory2":"Differences",
        "theory2": "Modern Taekwon-Do is very different from other martial arts. In fact, no other martial art is as advanced in terms of the sophistication and effectiveness of its techniques or the overall physical well-being it brings to practitioners.\n\nIt is a mistake to think that all physical actions performed using the hand and foot for self-defense are Taekwon-Do, since the theories, terminology, techniques, system, methods, rules, practice attire, and spiritual foundation were scientifically developed, systematized, and named by the author. Only those who practice techniques based on the author's theories, principles, and philosophy can be considered true students of Taekwon-Do.",
        "titletheory3":"When and where did Taekwon-Do begin?",
        "theory3": "A set of circumstances made it possible for Taekwon Do to originate and develop. In addition to my previous knowledge of Taek Kyon, I had the opportunity to learn Karate in Japan during the sad 36 years that my country was occupied by the Japanese. Shortly after Korea was liberated in 1945, I found myself in the privileged position of being a founding member of the newly formed South Korean Armed Forces. Thus I acquired on the one hand a sense of creativity and on the other hand the power to disseminate Taekwon-Do throughout the entire armed forces, despite furious opposition.",
        "titletheory4":"Emergence",
        "theory4": "The emergence of Taekwon-Do as an international martial art in a short period of time is due to several factors. The demons of contemporary society (moral corruption, materialism, egoism...) have created a spiritual vacuum. Taekwon-Do was able to compensate for this feeling of emptiness, decadence and lack of confidence.",
        "titletheory5":"Violent times",
        "theory5": "In addition, these were very violent times, when people felt the need to master a method of protection, and the superiority of the Taekwon-Do technique became widely recognized. My social status, the advantages of being the founder of Taekwon-Do and my good health also contributed to the rapid growth of Taekwon-Do throughout the world.",
        "titletheory6":"My Health",
        "theory6": "My practice of martial arts did much to improve the health God gave me. I was born weak and feeble and my calligraphy teacher encouraged me to learn Taek kyon when I was 15. In 1938, a few days before I was to leave Korea to study in Japan, an unexpected incident occurred in which I was implicated and my return to Korea would put me at risk of reprisals against me.",
        "titletheory7":"Karate Black Belt",
        "theory7": "I decided to become a black belt in karate while I was in Japan. I thought that these techniques were sufficient protection against those who might challenge me. I could not return to Korea, and I later initiated the national liberation movement known as the Pyongyang Student Soldier Incident. I was put in a Japanese military prison for a time. In January 1946, I was promoted to second lieutenant in the newly formed Republic of Korea and was assigned to the 4th Infantry Regiment in Kwangju, South Cholla Province as a platoon commander.",
        "titletheory8":"Arte marcial Nacional",
        "theory8": "I began to teach Karate to my soldiers as a means of physical and mental training. I then realized that we must develop our own national martial art, superior in spirit and technique to Japanese Karate. I was strongly convinced that by teaching it throughout the country I would be able to fulfill the promise I had made to my three comrades, who shared my imprisonment by the Japanese. The reason why our people are suffering so at the hands of the Japanese, I said, is that our ancestors failed to lead us wisely. They have exploited the people and eventually lost the country to foreign domination. If one day we regain our freedom and independence, let us not be the leaders of the people. Instead, let us devote ourselves to advising those who govern.",
        "titletheory9":"The name Taekwon-Do is born",
        "theory9": "It was with this ambition that I began to develop new techniques systematically beginning in March of that year. By the end of 1954, I had almost finished founding a new martial art for Korea, and on April 11, 1955, this art was given the name `TAEKWON-DO`.",
        "titletheory10":"My principles",
        "theory10": "On a spiritual level, Taekwon-Do is the result of traditional Eastern ethical and moral principles, as well as, of course, my personal philosophy.\n\nAlthough I am only 5 feet tall, I pride myself on having lived in strict accordance with my moral convictions.\n\nI tried to fight on the side of justice without any fear.\nThis was made possible by the formidable power and indomitable spirit instigated by Taekwon-Do.\n\nThe physical techniques of Taekwon-Do are based on the principles of modern science, particularly Newtonian physics, which teaches us how to generate maximum power. Military tactics of attack and defense were also incorporated,",
        "titletheory11":"My influences",
        "theory11": "I would like to point out that although Karate and Tae Kyon were used as references in the course of my study, the fundamental theories and principles of Taekwon-Do are totally different from other martial arts in the world. In March 1959, I took the military team to give a demonstration of Taekwon-Do abroad. We visited South Vietnam and Taiwan. It was the first trip of this kind in Korean history. On that occasion, I reiterated my resolve to leave my personal legacy to the world in the form of Taekwon-Do and formulated the following basic ideals for practitioners:", 
        "titletheory12":"Basic Ideals of Taekwon-Do",
        "theory12": "1) Develop a right mind and a strong body, to give you the confidence to always stand on the side of justice.\n\n2) We must unite with all men in a brotherhood of blood regardless of religion, race, nationality or ideological boundaries.\n\n3) We must dedicate ourselves to building a peaceful society where justice, morality, honesty and humanism prevail.",

        "titletheory1":"Hamurabi code",
        "theory1": "The ancient law in the East was similar to Hammurabi's law, 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,' and was rigorously enforced even if death was accidentally caused.\n\nIn this type of environment, and since the current free sparring system had not yet been developed, it was impossible for a martial arts student to practice or test his individual attacking and defensive skills against real moving opponents.\n\nIndividual progress was definitely hampered until an imaginative practitioner created the first forms.\n\nForms are several fundamental movements, most of which represent attacking or defensive techniques, put together according to a logical and fixed sequence.\n\nThe student systematically engages multiple imaginary opponents under various assumptions, using every attacking and blocking tool available from different directions. In this way, the practice of forms allows the student to review several fundamental movements in series, to develop sparring techniques, improve flexibility of movements, master body turns, strengthen muscles and develop breath control, develop fluid and controlled movements, and obtain rhythmic movements.\n\nIt also allows the student to acquire special techniques that cannot be obtained through fundamental exercises or sparring. In short, a tul can be compared to the tactics of a military unit or a word, if the fundamental movements were the individual training of a single soldier or the alphabet. In this way, the tul, the record of each movement, is a series of sparring matches, tests of power, feats, and characteristic beauty.\n\nAlthough sparring matches may merely indicate that an opponent is more or less advanced, tuls are a more accurate barometer of an individual's technique.",
        "titletheory2":"Considerations",
        "theory2": "The following should be considered while performing the forms:\n\n1. The tulle should begin and end at exactly the same point. This will indicate the precision of the performer.\n2. The correct posture and place of facing should be maintained constantly.\n3. The muscles of the body should be tense or relaxed at appropriate critical moments in the exercise.\n4. The exercise should be performed in a rhythmic motion with no stiffness.\n5. The movement should be accelerated or decelerated according to the instructions in this book.\n6. Each form should be perfected before learning the next.\n7. Students should know the purpose of each movement.\n8. Students should perform each movement realistically.\n9. Attack and defense techniques should be evenly distributed between left and right hands and feet.\n",
        "titletheory3":"The Reason for the 24 Shapes",
        "theory3": "The life of a human being, perhaps 100 years, can be considered as one day when compared to eternity. Therefore, we mortals are nothing more than mere travelers passing through the eternal years of an eon in one day.\n\nIt is obvious that no one can live more than a limited amount of time. However, most people foolishly enslave themselves to materialism as if they could live for thousands of years. And some people strive to leave a good spiritual legacy for the next generations, thus acquiring immortality. Obviously, the spiritual is perpetual while the material is not. Therefore, what we can do to leave something for the welfare of humanity is perhaps the most important thing in our lives.\n\nHere I leave Taekwon-Do for humanity as a footprint of the man of the end of the 20th century.\nThe 24 forms represent 24 hours, one day, or my entire life.",

He was infamous for having invented the first armed battleship (Kobukson) in 1592, which is said to have been the precursor of the modern submarine.
